# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a  C++ path planning  algorithm to  safely drive a car around a virtual highway in a [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2) provided by Udacity .  The car's localization, sensor fusion and previous path data is sent from the simulator to the C++ program. A sparse map list of waypoints around the highway is also given to the C++ program. The path planning algorithm uses this information to generate trajectories for the car to follow.

Several requirements from Udaciy are listed as follows.

* The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit
* The car should avoid collision
* The car should drive inside the lane, except for changing lanes
* The car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3
* The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway without any incidents listed above.

This project meets all the requirement as shown in the video
